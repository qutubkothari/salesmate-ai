## Feature 1: Broadcast System with Excel Upload

### Current Implementation Status: ? IMPLEMENTED

**Location:**
- [services/broadcastService.js](services/broadcastService.js)

### Configuration (Currently Hardcoded):
```javascript
// In services/broadcastService.js lines 11-15
const BATCH_SIZE = 5;                         // 5 messages per batch
const MESSAGE_DELAY = 12000;                  // 12 seconds between messages
const BATCH_COOLDOWN = 1 * 60 * 1000;        // 1 minute between batches
const MAX_RETRIES = 3;
const LOCK_TIMEOUT = 1 * 60 * 1000;          // 1 minute lock timeout
```

### How It Works:

#### Step 1: Schedule Broadcast (Text)

- Cron job processes queue every minute
- Rate limiting: 5 messages per batch, 1-minute cooldown between batches
- Unsubscribed users automatically skipped

```
/broadcast_image "Campaign Name" "tomorrow 10am" "Your message text"
```
or immediate:
```

  - Verify 1-minute cooldown between batches

- [ ] **Test 5:** Excel parsing
  - Test with various formats (with/without country codes)
  - Test with names in column B
  - Test with invalid numbers (should be skipped)

### Known Issues & Fixes Needed:

? **Issue 1: Hardcoded batch settings**
- **Problem:** BATCH_SIZE and delays are hardcoded
- **Fix Needed:** Make configurable per tenant in database or admin panel
- **File:** [services/broadcastService.js:11-15](services/broadcastService.js#L11-L15)

? **Issue 2: No admin UI for monitoring**
- **Problem:** No way to see broadcast status without checking database
- **Fix Needed:** Create admin endpoint to view queue status
- **Suggested Location:** `routes/api/broadcastStatus.js`

? **Working:** Excel parsing, rate limiting, unsubscribe handling, error retry logic

---

## Feature 2: AI Image Recognition for Products

### Current Implementation Status: ? IMPLEMENTED

**Location:**
- [routes/handlers/imageHandler.js](routes/handlers/imageHandler.js) (lines 178-270)
- [services/ocrService.js](services/ocrService.js)

### How It Works:

1. **Customer uploads product image**
2. **System extracts image URL** from Maytapi webhook
3. **AI analyzes image** using OpenAI Vision API (GPT-4 Vision)
4. **OCR extracts text** if product code is visible
5. **Product matching** against database using code or description
6. **Response sent** with product name, price, and availability

### Testing Checklist:

- [ ] **Test 1:** Upload clear product image with visible text
  - Take photo of a product with visible product code (e.g., "NFF 8x80")
  - Send to WhatsApp bot as customer
  - Verify bot identifies product and returns:
    - Product name
    - Product code
    - Price per carton
    - Availability status

- [ ] **Test 2:** Upload image without text (visual only)
  - Send image of product without visible codes
  - Verify bot attempts visual recognition
  - Should return "Could not identify" if no match

- [ ] **Test 3:** Product context tracking
  - After image recognition, send follow-up: "What is the price?"
  - Bot should remember the last identified product
  - Verify conversation context is saved in `conversations.last_product_discussed`

- [ ] **Test 4:** Multiple images in sequence
  - Upload 3 different product images
  - Verify each is processed independently
  - Verify last one is saved to context

### Code Flow:
```
Customer sends image
  ?
routes/webhook.js detects message.type === 'image'
  ?
routes/handlers/imageHandler.js ? handleCustomerImageUpload()
  ?
services/ocrService.js ? identifyProductFromImage()
  ?
OpenAI Vision API analyzes image
  ?
Extract product code from OCR text
  ?
Query products table for match
  ?
Return price & details
  ?
Save to conversations.last_product_discussed
```

### Known Issues & Fixes Needed:

? **Working:** Image URL extraction, OCR text detection, product matching, price display

? **Issue 1: Context not always saved**
- **Problem:** Sometimes `last_product_discussed` is not updated
- **File:** [routes/handlers/imageHandler.js:223-246](routes/handlers/imageHandler.js#L223-L246)
- **Fix:** Already has extensive logging, check if conversation record exists

? **Issue 2: No image quality validation**
- **Problem:** Blurry images go to AI without validation
- **Fix Needed:** Add image quality check before OCR
- **Suggested:** Use OpenCV or similar to detect blur

? **Good:** Extensive debug logging for troubleshooting

---

## Feature 3: Document Retrieval from GCS Bucket

### Current Implementation Status: ?? PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

**Location:**
- [services/pdfDeliveryService.js](services/pdfDeliveryService.js) (PDF upload to GCS)
- [services/whatsappService.js](services/whatsappService.js) (sendDocument function)
- Intent detection in smart router

### What's Implemented:

? **Sales Order PDF Delivery:**
- After order confirmation, system generates PDF
- Uploads to GCS bucket
- Sends download link via WhatsApp
- Location: [services/pdfDeliveryService.js:102-128](services/pdfDeliveryService.js#L102-L128)

### What's Missing:

? **Product Catalogs Retrieval:**
- No service to fetch pre-uploaded catalogs from GCS
- No intent detection for "send catalog" requests

? **Technical PDFs Retrieval:**
- No service to fetch technical documentation from GCS
- No mapping of product ? technical PDF

? **Product Images Retrieval:**
- No service to fetch product images from GCS
- No product image gallery system

### Required Fixes:

#### Fix 1: Create Document Retrieval Service

**File to Create:** `services/documentRetrievalService.js`

```javascript
// Required functionality:
1. List documents in GCS bucket by category (catalogs, technical, images)
2. Search for documents by product name/code
3. Generate temporary signed URLs for secure access
4. Cache frequently requested documents
```

#### Fix 2: Add Intent Detection for Document Requests

**File to Modify:** [services/intentRecognitionService.js](services/intentRecognitionService.js)

```javascript
// Add new intents:
- REQUEST_CATALOG
- REQUEST_TECHNICAL_PDF
- REQUEST_PRODUCT_IMAGE
- REQUEST_PRICE_LIST

// Example patterns:
- "send me the catalog"
- "do you have technical specs for 8x80?"
- "show me product images"
- "latest price list"
```

#### Fix 3: GCS Bucket Structure

**Required folder structure in GCS:**
```
gs://your-bucket/
  ??? catalogs/
  ?   ??? main_catalog_2025.pdf
  ?   ??? seasonal_offers.pdf
  ??? technical_docs/
  ?   ??? NFF_8x80_specs.pdf
  ?   ??? NFF_10x100_specs.pdf
  ?   ??? installation_guide.pdf
  ??? product_images/
  ?   ??? NFF_8x80_01.jpg
  ?   ??? NFF_8x80_02.jpg
  ?   ??? NFF_10x100_01.jpg
  ??? pricelists/
      ??? pricelist_2025.pdf
```

#### Fix 4: Admin Upload Interface

**Required:**
- Web interface for admins to upload documents to GCS
- Tag documents with product codes
- Set document types (catalog, technical, image, pricelist)

### Testing Plan (After Implementation):

- [ ] **Test 1:** Request catalog
  - Send: "send me the catalog"
  - Should receive: PDF download link from GCS

- [ ] **Test 2:** Request product-specific doc
  - Send: "technical specs for NFF 8x80"
  - Should receive: Relevant technical PDF

- [ ] **Test 3:** Request product images
  - Send: "show me pictures of 10x100"
  - Should receive: Image carousel or links

- [ ] **Test 4:** Request price list
  - Send: "latest price list"
  - Should receive: Current pricelist PDF

### Implementation Priority:

1. **HIGH:** Create `documentRetrievalService.js` with GCS integration
2. **HIGH:** Add intent detection for document requests
3. **MEDIUM:** Create admin upload interface
4. **LOW:** Add image gallery/carousel display

---

## Quick Test Commands

### For Broadcast:
```bash
# As admin, send to your WhatsApp:
/broadcast_now "Test" "Hello!"

# Then upload Excel file with format:
# Column A: Phone numbers
# 919106886259
# 919876543210
```

### For Image Recognition:
```bash
# As customer, just send a product image
# Bot should respond automatically with product details
```

### For Document Retrieval (After Implementation):
```bash
# As customer:
"send me the catalog"
"technical specs for 8x80"
"show product images"
```

---

## Configuration Check

### Environment Variables Required:

#### For Broadcast:
- `MAYTAPI_PRODUCT_ID` - Your Maytapi product ID
- `MAYTAPI_API_KEY` - Your Maytapi API key
- Database tables: `bulk_schedules`, `broadcast_processing_lock`, `broadcast_batch_log`

#### For Image Recognition:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - OpenAI API key for Vision
- Database tables: `products`, `conversations`

#### For Document Retrieval:
- `GOOGLE_CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET` - GCS bucket name
- `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` - Path to service account JSON
- `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID` - Your GCP project ID

---

## Database Schema Check

### Required Tables:

1. **bulk_schedules** - Broadcast message queue
2. **broadcast_processing_lock** - Prevent concurrent processing
3. **broadcast_batch_log** - Track batch execution
4. **products** - Product catalog
5. **conversations** - Customer conversation context
6. **unsubscribed_users** - Opt-out list
7. **orders** - Order history

---

## Next Steps

1. ? Broadcast: Test current implementation
2. ? Image Recognition: Test current implementation
3. ? Document Retrieval: **NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION**
   - Create `documentRetrievalService.js`
   - Add intent detection
   - Upload sample documents to GCS
   - Test retrieval

---

## Support & Debugging

### Enable Debug Logging:
```bash
export DEBUG_BROADCAST=1
```

### Check Logs:
```bash
gcloud app logs read --limit=100
# or
cat app_logs.txt | grep -E "BROADCAST|IMAGE|OCR|DOCUMENT"
```

### Common Issues:

**Broadcast not sending:**
- Check `bulk_schedules` table for status
- Verify cron job is running
- Check cooldown hasn't blocked processing

**Image recognition failing:**
- Check OpenAI API quota
- Verify image URL is accessible
- Check products table for matching items

**Documents not retrieving:**
- Verify GCS bucket permissions
- Check service account has storage.objects.get permission
- Verify files exist in bucket

# Verify bucket exists
gsutil ls gs://your-bucket/

# Check service account has access
gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=credentials.json
gsutil ls gs://your-bucket/catalogs/
```

**Check 2: Environment Variables**
```bash
# In app.yaml, verify:
GOOGLE_CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET: "your-bucket-name"
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS: "path/to/service-account.json"
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID: "your-project-id"
```

**Check 3: Intent Detection**
```bash
# Check logs for intent recognition
gcloud app logs read --limit=50 | grep "INTENT"

# Should see:
# [INTENT] Recognized: REQUEST_CATALOG
```

**Check 4: File Exists**
```bash
# List files in category
gsutil ls gs://your-bucket/catalogs/

# If empty, upload documents!
```

### Broadcast Not Sending?

**Check 1: Queue Status**
```sql
SELECT * FROM bulk_schedules WHERE status = 'pending' LIMIT 10;
```

**Check 2: Cooldown**
```sql
SELECT * FROM broadcast_batch_log ORDER BY started_at DESC LIMIT 5;
```

**Check 3: Logs**
```bash
gcloud app logs read --limit=100 | grep BROADCAST
```

### Image Recognition Not Working?

**Check 1: OpenAI API**
```bash
# Verify API key is set
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY

# Check quota/limits
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/models -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

# Document Retrieval System - Setup Guide

## Overview
The document retrieval system allows customers to request catalogs, price lists, technical documentation, and product images via WhatsApp. Documents are stored in Google Cloud Storage (GCS) and retrieved on demand.

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Google Cloud Storage Bucket** - Already configured
2. **Service Account** with Storage permissions
3. **Environment Variables** properly set

---

## Step 1: Verify Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in your `app.yaml` or `.env`:

```yaml
env_variables:
  GOOGLE_CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET: "your-bucket-name"
  GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS: "path/to/service-account.json"
  GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID: "your-project-id"
```

---

## Step 2: Create GCS Bucket Folder Structure

Run this script to create the required folder structure in your GCS bucket:

```bash
# Using gsutil (Google Cloud SDK)
gsutil mb gs://your-bucket-name  # Create bucket (if not exists)

# Create folders
gsutil -m mkdir \
  gs://your-bucket-name/catalogs/ \
  gs://your-bucket-name/pricelists/ \
  gs://your-bucket-name/technical_docs/ \
  gs://your-bucket-name/product_images/ \
  gs://your-bucket-name/installation_guides/ \
  gs://your-bucket-name/brochures/
```

**Folder Structure:**
```
gs://your-bucket/
??? catalogs/               # Product catalogs
??? pricelists/            # Price lists
??? technical_docs/        # Technical specifications
?   ??? NFF_8x80_specs.pdf
?   ??? NFF_10x100_specs.pdf
?   ??? ...
??? product_images/        # Product photos
?   ??? NFF_8x80_01.jpg
?   ??? NFF_8x80_02.jpg
?   ??? NFF_10x100_01.jpg
?   ??? ...
??? installation_guides/   # Installation instructions
??? brochures/            # Marketing brochures
```

---

## Step 3: Upload Sample Documents

### Using gsutil:

```bash
# Upload catalog
gsutil cp main_catalog_2025.pdf gs://your-bucket/catalogs/

# Upload price list
gsutil cp pricelist_2025.pdf gs://your-bucket/pricelists/

# Upload technical docs (use product code in filename)
gsutil cp NFF_8x80_specs.pdf gs://your-bucket/technical_docs/
gsutil cp NFF_10x100_specs.pdf gs://your-bucket/technical_docs/

# Upload product images (use product code in filename)
gsutil cp NFF_8x80_01.jpg gs://your-bucket/product_images/
gsutil cp NFF_10x100_01.jpg gs://your-bucket/product_images/
```

### Using Google Cloud Console:

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage)
2. Navigate to your bucket
3. Click **Upload Files** or **Upload Folder**
4. Upload files to the appropriate folder

---

## Step 4: Set Proper Permissions

### Make Bucket Publicly Readable (Recommended for shared documents):

```bash
gsutil iam ch allUsers:objectViewer gs://your-bucket
```

### Or use Signed URLs (More secure):
The system automatically generates signed URLs with 60-minute expiry. No additional setup needed.

---

## Step 5: Configure Tenant-Specific Documents (Optional)

If you have multiple tenants with different catalogs:

1. Add columns to `tenants` table:
```sql
ALTER TABLE tenants
ADD COLUMN catalog_file_path TEXT,
ADD COLUMN price_list_file_path TEXT;
```

2. Update tenant records:
```sql
UPDATE tenants
SET catalog_file_path = 'catalogs/tenant_abc_catalog.pdf',
    price_list_file_path = 'pricelists/tenant_abc_pricelist.pdf'
WHERE id = 'tenant-id-here';
```

---

## Step 6: File Naming Conventions

For the system to automatically find product-specific documents, use these naming conventions:

### Technical Documents:
- Format: `PRODUCTCODE_specs.pdf` or `PRODUCTCODE_technical.pdf`
- Examples:
  - `NFF_8x80_specs.pdf`
  - `NFF_10x100_technical.pdf`
  - `8x80_datasheet.pdf`

### Product Images:
- Format: `PRODUCTCODE_##.jpg` or `PRODUCTCODE_image##.jpg`
- Examples:

## Admin Upload Interface (To Be Developed)

For easier document management, consider creating a web interface:

### Features Needed:
1. File upload form
2. Category selection dropdown
3. Product code tagging
4. Preview uploaded documents
5. Delete/replace documents

### Endpoint Structure:
```javascript
POST /admin/documents/upload
- category: 'catalog' | 'pricelist' | 'technical' | 'product_image'
- file: multipart/form-data
- productCode: (optional, for product-specific docs)
- metadata: {description, uploadedBy, etc.}

GET /admin/documents/list?category=technical
- Returns list of all documents in category

DELETE /admin/documents/:path
- Removes document from GCS
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "GCS not configured" Error

**Solution:**
1. Check environment variables are set
2. Verify service account JSON file path
3. Ensure service account has `storage.objects.get` permission

```bash
# Test GCS access
gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=path/to/service-account.json
gsutil ls gs://your-bucket
```

### Issue: "Document not found" Error

**Solution:**
1. Verify file exists in bucket:
   ```bash
   gsutil ls gs://your-bucket/catalogs/
   ```
2. Check file naming matches conventions
3. For product-specific docs, ensure product code is in filename

### Issue: Customer receives broken link

**Solution:**
1. Check if file is publicly readable:
   ```bash
   gsutil ls -L gs://your-bucket/catalogs/file.pdf
   ```
2. Verify signed URL hasn't expired (60 minutes default)
3. Check file actually exists in GCS

### Issue: Wrong document returned

**Solution:**
1. System returns latest file by date
2. If wrong file is latest, rename or delete old files
3. Or configure tenant-specific paths in database

---

## Monitoring & Analytics

Track document requests in logs:

```bash
# View document request logs
gcloud app logs read --limit=100 | grep -E "DOC_REQUEST|DOC_RETRIEVAL"

# Check which documents are most requested
gcloud app logs read --limit=1000 | grep "DOC_REQUEST" | \
  awk '{print $NF}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

---

## Security Considerations

### Signed URLs (Current Method - Recommended):
? Temporary access (60 minutes)
? No public access needed
? Revocable

### Public URLs:
? Simpler setup
? Anyone with link can access
? No expiry

**Recommendation:** Keep using signed URLs for sensitive documents (price lists, technical specs). Make catalogs and brochures public for easier sharing.

---

## Batch Upload Script

For uploading multiple documents at once:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# upload_docs.sh

BUCKET="your-bucket-name"

# Upload all PDFs in a folder
for file in ./technical_docs/*.pdf; do
    filename=$(basename "$file")
    echo "Uploading $filename..."
    gsutil cp "$file" "gs://$BUCKET/technical_docs/$filename"
done

# Upload all images
for file in ./product_images/*.{jpg,png}; do
    filename=$(basename "$file")
    echo "Uploading $filename..."
    gsutil cp "$file" "gs://$BUCKET/product_images/$filename"
done

echo "Upload complete!"
```

Run with:
```bash
chmod +x upload_docs.sh
./upload_docs.sh
```

---

## Next Steps

1. ? **Upload initial documents** to GCS bucket
2. ? **Test with real customers** to gather feedback
3. ? **Build admin upload interface** for easier management
4. ? **Add analytics** to track most requested documents
5. ? **Create document versioning** system
6. ? **Add multi-language support** for documents

---

## Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# List all documents
gsutil ls -r gs://your-bucket/

# Upload file
gsutil cp local-file.pdf gs://your-bucket/category/

# Delete file
gsutil rm gs://your-bucket/category/file.pdf

# Make file public
gsutil acl ch -u AllUsers:R gs://your-bucket/category/file.pdf

# Generate signed URL manually (for testing)
gsutil signurl -d 1h path/to/service-account.json gs://your-bucket/file.pdf
```

---

## ?? File Naming Rules

**IMPORTANT:** For product-specific documents to work automatically, follow these naming conventions:

### Technical Documents:
? `NFF_8x80_specs.pdf`
? `NFF_10x100_technical.pdf`
? `8x80_datasheet.pdf`

? `specifications.pdf` (no product code)
? `tech doc.pdf` (no product code)

### Product Images:
? `NFF_8x80_01.jpg`
? `NFF_8x80_02.jpg`
? `10x100_front.jpg`

? `image1.jpg` (no product code)
? `photo.jpg` (no product code)

### Catalogs & Price Lists:
? Any filename works (system returns the latest)
? Recommended: Include date in name
   - `catalog_2025.pdf`
   - `pricelist_january_2025.pdf`

---

## ?? Troubleshooting

### "No catalog available"
**Problem:** No files in `catalogs/` folder
**Solution:**
```bash
gsutil ls gs://$BUCKET/catalogs/
# If empty:
gsutil cp your-catalog.pdf gs://$BUCKET/catalogs/
```

### "No technical documentation found"
**Problem:** Filename doesn't contain product code
**Solution:** Rename file to include product code:
```bash
# Wrong: specs.pdf
# Right:
gsutil cp specs.pdf gs://$BUCKET/technical_docs/NFF_8x80_specs.pdf
```

### "GCS not configured"
**Problem:** Environment variables not set
**Solution:** Check `app.yaml` has:
```yaml
env_variables:
  GOOGLE_CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET: "your-bucket-name"
  GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS: "path/to/service-account.json"
```

### Link doesn't work / Access denied
**Problem:** Permissions issue
**Solution:** Make bucket publicly readable:
```bash
gsutil iam ch allUsers:objectViewer gs://$BUCKET
```
Or the system will automatically generate signed URLs.
