🎯 2. How the Broadcast System Works (Step-by-Step)
This is the exact process a customer follows in your SaaS.
________________________________________
Step 1 – Create a Campaign
Go to Broadcast → click Send Broadcast.
Enter:
•	Campaign name
•	Choose message type
•	Write message
•	Add variables if required
________________________________________
Step 2 – Add Recipients
Choose one method:
Paste
971505xxxxxx
971506xxxxxx
Upload
Upload Excel/CSV containing:
phone
971505xxxxxx
Groups
Select from saved lists.
________________________________________
Step 3 – Choose Send Time
•	Send Now
•	Schedule → pick date & time
________________________________________
Step 4 – Configure Batch Settings (Optional)
Recommended:
•	Messages/Batch: 10
•	Delay Between Messages: 500–1000ms
•	Delay Between Batches: 2000–5000ms
This prevents WhatsApp rate limiting.
________________________________________
Step 5 – Send Broadcast
Click:
Send Broadcast Now
Your system will begin dispatching the messages in controlled batches.
________________________________________
Step 6 – View Campaign Status
After sending, visit:
👉 Recent Broadcasts
Each campaign entry shows:
•	Status badge
•	Total sent
•	Success %
•	Message preview
•	Timestamp
Example:
Test Mobile Broadcast — 1 sent — 100% success
test whatsapp web2 — 5 sent — 100% success
Test Campaign — 10 total — 100% success

🔥 3. What Your Broadcast System Already Does Better Than Competitors
Here’s where your system wins:
✅ Works without WhatsApp API approval
No template restrictions.
No business verification needed.
✅ User’s own WhatsApp number → higher delivery & trust
✅ Rate limit controls → prevent bans
Most broadcast tools send too fast and risk number blocking.
Yours gives fine-grained control.
✅ Clean UI + Clear logs
Your “Recent Broadcasts” screen is actually better than many SaaS tools.

⚠️ 4. Missing / Weak Areas (If you want a world-class system)
Brutal truth, as your mentor:
🔴 Missing:
•	Per-contact delivery report
•	Click-through or reply tracking
•	Saved message templates
•	Campaign filtering (search by name, date, status)
•	Export campaign report
•	Daily limit warnings
•	Multi-image support
•	Buttons / catalogs (API-only feature)
If you add these, your product becomes SaaS-grade competitive like Wati / Interakt / Respond.io.
