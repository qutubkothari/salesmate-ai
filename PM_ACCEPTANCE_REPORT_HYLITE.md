# Hylite Scenario — PM Acceptance Report

Date: 2026-01-25

## Overall Status
**Partially meets requirements.** Core WhatsApp lead capture, assignment, AI lead qualification, and dashboards exist. Missing or incomplete items remain for IndiaMart and some FSM lead-entry UI, plus KPI-based “suggested lead increase” panel verification.

| WhatsApp (salesman number) → assigned to that salesman | **Pass (backend)** | [routes/api/salesmanWhatsapp.js](routes/api/salesmanWhatsapp.js#L1-L116) | UI flow needs live test. |
| Email (company inbox) capture | **Partial** | [LEAD_MANAGEMENT_FLOW_ANALYSIS.md](LEAD_MANAGEMENT_FLOW_ANALYSIS.md#L7-L18) | Marked READY in doc; live UI flow not verified. |

| Round-robin auto-assign toggle | **Pass (backend)** | [services/leadAutoCreateService.js](services/leadAutoCreateService.js#L318-L419) | Live settings verification needed per tenant. |

| Smart weighting / performance scoring for assignment | **Pass (backend)** | [services/leadAutoCreateService.js](services/leadAutoCreateService.js#L345-L419) | Needs KPI dashboard + suggestion UX. |

## 3) AI Lead Qualification & Context
| Requirement | Status | Evidence | Gaps / Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Auto-qualify leads from WhatsApp | **Pass (backend)** | [services/leadAutoCreateService.js](services/leadAutoCreateService.js#L1-L214) | Needs cross-channel qualification verification. |

| Product + document context in replies | **Partial** | [public/dashboard.html](public/dashboard.html#L172-L207) | Backend exists but live flow not verified end-to-end. |

---

## 4) WhatsApp Web (Human-like responses)
| Requirement | Status | Evidence | Gaps / Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Connect WhatsApp Web (WAHA) | **Pass (backend)** | [routes/api/whatsappWeb.js](routes/api/whatsappWeb.js#L1-L107) | Needs live test with tenant session. |

---

## Verdict
- **Meets:** WhatsApp lead capture, auto-assign modes, AI lead scoring, dashboards, WAHA connectivity.  
- **Not fully met:** KPI-driven “suggest increase leads” UI and controls, and multi-channel end-to-end testing.

---

## Immediate Next Actions (Recommended)
1) Deploy IndiaMart webhook and manual lead entry UI.  
2) Add management insights panel for performance suggestions (2–4 hours).  
3) Run live tests per channel and confirm assignment behavior with caps.
